This is my timeline. 

Sat: First I was outraged, not able to see another murder on a black person at the hands of law enforcement. 

What do I say, how do I put my thoughts in words. First I had to talk to my network, my wife, my black friends, and collate my thoughts. This would have been easier in a non-covid world. In a social gathering. The way I have done this before. 

Racism is a unfortuante natural state. 

Maybe a dive into my background explains things:

Parents are from trinidad and tobago, emigrated to the US in 1970, settling in NY.
Both parents have barely high school degrees.
Dad taxi driver / mechanic / real estate, insurance sales, Mom waitress / nurses assistant
Educated in private school in NY, mostly white, very little minorities. 

Are we able to put this is a place where we all get outaged? Or is it just the background we live in?
