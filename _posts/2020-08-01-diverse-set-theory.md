what do we say, what do we do?

I am not always able to do what I say, and I am not always able to say what I do.
But should be hold more accountable to those things we say, are we going to make a change.
Is there progress with just words or does action NEED to follow it. 
Can a word change it, or is a word a start, and action HAVE to follow.
did the emancipation proclamation free the the people, or did the people free the people.
Curious.
