### A death ###

Why does Mr. Boseman’s death hit so hard. 

Maybe it is because he was King T’challa.

Maybe it is because he played so many icons on the big screen in recent history.

Maybe it is because he was good looking.

Maybe it is because his death comes at a time when we as people are struggling with scary nationality, violent racial injustice, human rights injustice and an epidemic that magnifies it all. 

Maybe he symbolizes a place where we want to be and celebrate, and his death hurts a little more because it symbolizes us losing some hope. That a place where we want to be is not here anymore,

I don’t know. But it hurts.
